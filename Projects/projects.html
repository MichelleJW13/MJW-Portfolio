          <br>
          To bring this project to life, I began with a clear vision of honoring Raymond Loewy's legacy through a concise, chronological biography. I wanted to capture the essence of his revolutionary ideas and creations not only through words but also through visual elements.</p>
        <p><strong>Content Creation:</strong>

<p><strong>From Classroom Assignment to Branding Idea:</strong>
  <br>
  The seeds of Dearly Design were sown in 2014 during a college class assignment, where I was tasked with creating a logo. Little did I know that this seemingly routine project would ignite my passion for design. The original concept, inspired by Cervidae art and typography, was intended for a fictional stationary brand. However, the creative process opened doors to a multitude of new ideas and opportunities.</p>

<p>For my latest venture, I embarked on an exciting journey into the world of travel and educational videography, creating captivating content for my YouTube channel titled "Wander and Flourish."

I conceptualized each video, carefully selecting locations and themes that showcase the natural beauty and cultural richness of this unique region.</p>
<p><strong>Content Creation:</strong>
  <br>
  Similar to the meticulous process of crafting a photograph, I approached video content creation with attention to detail.

Through expert editing, I transformed raw footage into engaging stories that transport viewers to these stunning landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>Editing Mastery:</strong>
  <br>
  Leveraging the power of Adobe Creative Suite and Sony software, I honed my editing skills to bring out the essence of the Midwest and the Rocky Mountains. From color grading to sound design, every element was carefully tailored to evoke the unique character and allure of this region.</p>
<p><strong>Viewer Engagement:</strong>
  <br>
  "Wander and Flourish" is an invitation to explore the American Midwest, especially the mesmerizing Rocky Mountains. I wanted my viewers, whether they're travelers planning an adventure or nature enthusiasts, to feel deeply connected to these locations. Each video serves as a virtual journey, inspiring wanderlust and an appreciation for the Midwest's natural wonders.</p>
<hr>
<p>In summary, "Wander and Flourish" showcases my seamless transition from photography to travel/educational videography, with a special focus on the American Midwest and the awe-inspiring Rocky Mountains. It's a testament to my ability to adapt visual storytelling skills and leverage software tools effectively, all while highlighting the unique charm and beauty of this remarkable region.</p>

<p>My portfolio website has undergone a remarkable evolution, transforming from a simple HTML-only single-page site to a comprehensive, content-filled platform that showcases my skills and projects using a variety of coding languages. The journey began in April of 2023 when I embarked on the path of becoming a Software Developer through Amazon's Career Choice program. At the outset, my knowledge was centered around basic HTML, and I was in the process of learning how to enhance the styling of HTML pages using CSS.</p>
<hr>
<div class="h2">Project Highlights:</div>
<hr>
<p><strong>Foundations in HTML:</strong>
  <br>
  The initial version of my portfolio was built upon the foundations of HTML, allowing me to create a basic structure to present my work and information. This phase marked the beginning of my coding journey, laying the groundwork for the more intricate developments that followed.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to CSS Styling:</strong>
  <br>
  As I delved into the intricacies of CSS, I discovered its versatility and the power it holds in enhancing the visual appeal of web pages. The newfound understanding of CSS played a pivotal role in tidying up the layout and design elements of my portfolio, reflecting my skills as a graphic designer transitioning into Front-End Development.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion into Front-End Development:</strong>
  <br>
  Driven by my background in graphic design, I eagerly explored the realm of Front-End Development. This expansion involved incorporating additional coding languages and technologies to elevate my portfolio beyond a simple HTML structure. I embraced the challenges and opportunities presented by JavaScript, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, and other tools that enhanced interactivity and user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Content Enrichment:</strong>
  <br>
  Over time, the focus shifted from a basic presentation to content enrichment. I incorporated various types of code to dynamically display my projects, achievements, and skills. The portfolio evolved into a multi-page website that not only serves as a showcase but also as a testament to my growth as a Software Developer.</p>
<hr>
<p>The evolution of my portfolio website stands as a dynamic representation of my learning journey, starting with the fundamentals and progressively incorporating diverse coding languages and technologies. This project not only reflects my technical prowess but also highlights my passion for continuous learning and improvement in the ever-evolving field of web development.</p>
